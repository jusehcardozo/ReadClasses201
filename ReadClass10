The article talks about some powerful features you’ll find in the new version of Veeam like:
VeeamZIP Backup
Veeam Explorer for Exchange
Veeam Explorer for Storage Snapshots
Veeam Explorer for SharePoint
Quick Migration for VMware
File Copy Job
VM Copy Job
FastSCP Editor
Native tape support
File level recovery from backup
Whole VM recovery from backup
VM file recovery from backup.
Veeam Backup Free Edition can be summarized in these three powerful categories:

VeeamZIP – Creates an ad-hoc backup of a running VM, which gives you many benefits such as being able to easily copy a backup to another host without having to 
power off the original VM
Powerful and flexible restores – Supports a number of recovery scenarios, including recovery of an entire VM, guest OS files and individual application items
Quick Migration (VMware) – Migrates a live VM between hosts or datastores with minimal downtime and without requiring clusters, shared storage, or even
VMware vMotion or Storage vMotion.
VeeamZIP delivers technology that lets you create backups of running VMs. With VeeamZIP, you have to specify only two things – the VM you want to backup and 
where your resulting backup file will go.
Veeam Backup Free Edition supports several data recovery scenarios, beginning with recovery of a VM file and going all the way to restoring an entire VM
Quick Migration lets you migrate live VMs between hosts or datastores without requiring clusters, shared storage or advanced functionality that is not available
in lower-level hypervisor editions. Quick Migration works well even in environments with slow or high latency connections that prevent VMware vMotion an
Hyper-V Live Migration from working!
