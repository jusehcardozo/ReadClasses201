This articles talk about SSD Data Recovery Best Practices and How to Erase a Hard Drive Using DBAN.

Unfortunately, SSD failures are hard to detect. Unlike HDDs, SSDs do not emit audible signals like whirring, clicking, or humming when they’re approaching a 
complete shutdown. SSDs can operate in silence until they simply stop functioning.
Still, SSDs do display warning signals that educated users can learn to identify. Armed with the proper knowledge, an individual may be able to detect probable 
SSD failure and can take steps to intervene.
Here are some of the most common indicators that your SSD may be approaching its read/write cycle limit or is experiencing physical issues:
Bad blocks, file system repair, crashing and read-only mode.
How you approach fixing an SSD that is failing to perform properly depends on the source of its issues. If there is a physical problem like hardware damage or
degraded flash cells, the SSD may need to be replaced. However, if the dysfunction derives from a logical error—bad blocks, software malfunctions, malware, outdated
firmware, etc.—a handful of techniques may achieve SSD recovery.
Some recovery options include: 
Formatting the drive and redownloading the operating system, power cycling the SSD, idling in the boot menu, updating SSD firmware and updating drivers.

Darik's Boot And Nuke (DBAN) is an entirely free data destruction program used to completely erase all the files on a hard drive.
This includes everything—every installed application, all your personal files, and even the operating system.
DBAN has to run while the operating system isn't in use so you'll need to burn the program to a disc (CD, DVD, USB) and run it from there.
This website gives you the steps on how to erase a hard drive using DBAN.
