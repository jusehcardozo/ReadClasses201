This article talks about the role of the Help Desk Professional.
To me, that role/knowledge is important for what we are going to be doing because they have to deal with custumers or users that need help at one point.
And we might be doing this part as well depending on what job we ended up taking in the future.
In additional to having a strong set of technical skills, help desk technicians also need to have a strong set of soft skills.
They are the firs line of support for users, maybe from companies that bought a program from the company the help desk professional works for.
They usually have hard skills such as: Tecnichal skills, Security skills, Troubleshooting skills and Business skills.
Also Soft skills such as: Communication skills, Personal Skills, Writing skills and Training skills.
