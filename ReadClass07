PS1 - Should you learn PowerShell? - Tech Thoughts
Who needs malware? IBM says most hackers just PowerShell through boxes now, leaving little in the way of footprints • The Register

The Youtube video speaks of attacks using malicious PowerShell usage, called “Living of the Land”. These attacks are hard to detect, usually don’t ring any
alarms and allow attackers to do their dirty job as they please. Apparently these attacks are somewhat easy to conduct and hard for cybersecurity companies to detect.
This is post one on a journey towards learning PowerShell. A commitment to learn PowerShell will not be a small investment of your time. 
Before diving straight in it’s worth exploring what PowerShell is capable of, who is using it, and how it compares to other languages.
You can then determine if PowerShell makes sense for you in today’s technology landscape.
Let's start with the obvious question. What is PowerShell? PowerShell is a command-line shell interface made by Microsoft that enables system administrators and
power users to manage computers from the command line. PowerShell is also a scripting language, built on .NET which can be used for automating administrative
tasks and configuration management.
What's in a Shell?
Systems and Network Admins/Engineers will often gravitate towards a particular operating system, Linux or Windows. This may be based on personal preference, or because
the environment they work in leverages one over the other. The following scenario typically unfolds as a result:
Linux → Bash → Python
Windows → PowerShell → C#
This is changing now that Bash is available on Windows, and PowerShell is available on Linux. The lines are truly starting to blur, so lets explore these two languages.
Why you should learn PowerShell
Now that you’ve gotten some insight into language outcomes (create vs do/manage), job titles that use PowerShell, and where PowerShell is used, you should have a
pretty clear indication if PowerShell is the right choice for you.
PowerShell is a fantastically powerful language that can do great things for your environment, and your career. While your counterparts are performing manual steps,
the automation capabilities of PowerShell can have you accomplishing similar tasks in a fraction of the time. It can be the difference between an initiative taking
weeks vs minutes.
Manual repetitive steps are also prone to mistakes. PowerShell can test outcomes and ensure accuracy for every initiative. Better still, it’s versatility and 
availability on so many platforms means you only have to learn it once, and can apply it everywhere.
Who needs malware? IBM says most hackers just PowerShell through boxes now, leaving little in the way of footprints
A company's internal network, once compromised, is now more likely to be ransacked by automated scripts than a piece of malware.
This according to researchers with IBM's X-Force, who found that in 2018 just 43 per cent of the attacks it analyzed utilized any sort of locally installed files.
Rather, the hackers utilized PowerShell scripts to execute their dirty deeds in memory without significantly touching file systems, if at all.
This finding is important because it is another reminder that admins can no longer solely rely on detecting malicious executables and similar data on hard drives and
other storage, to identify cyber-intrusions.
"PowerShell is useful in data collection and analysis, but it is also favored by malicious actors who use it to forego the file system and inject malicious code
directly into memory, thus enhancing obfuscation, and often evading security controls designed to detect malware deployments," the IBM report reads.
"Threat actors of all skill levels have expanded their capabilities using PowerShell over the last few years. IBM X-Force IRIS has seen cases wherein 
complete malicious toolkits were contained within PowerShell scripts."
