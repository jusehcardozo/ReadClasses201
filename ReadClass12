What Is pfSense?
pfSense is a free, customized distribution of FreeBSD that can turn an old computer into a full featured router and firewall.
pfSense was created in 2004 as a fork of the popular m0n0wall project. The main difference between pfSense and m0n0wall is that pfSense is designed mainly to be
installed on PCs instead of embedded devices which allows pfSense to offer more flexibility and features.
pfSense is very flexible and can easily be adapted to numerous applications ranging from a home router to a firewall for a large corporate network.
pfSense is easy to install and maintain offering a very useful web based user interface. pfSense includes many features that are often only found in expensive
commercial routers.
Why Use pfSense Instead of Another Router?
pfSense is fast, free, and stable offering tons of great features.
If you have an existing router that doesn't offer the features, or performance you need pfSense is a great choice to replace it with. Offering complete control of the
hardware you can customize your pfSense system with the components you want.
If you've ever shopped for routers or firewalls before, you probably know that depending on the features you are looking for they can be quite expensive.
By using pfSense you can save a ton of money without compromising on features.
