The video basically shows how to use command prompt, also shows how to use as administrator and teaches to run codes and shortcuts.

What is SMB protocol?
The Server Message Block (SMB) is a network protocol that enables users to communicate with remote computers and servers — to use their resources or share, open,
and edit files. It’s also referred to as the server/client protocol, as the server has a resource that it can share with the client.
Like any network file sharing protocol, SMB block needs network ports to communicate with other systems. Originally, it used port 139 that allowed computers to 
communicate on the same network. But since Windows 2000, SMB uses port 445 and the TCP network protocol to “talk” to other computers over the internet.
So what is SMB and how is it used? The SMB protocol creates a connection between the server and the client by sending multiple request-response messages back and forth.

Imagine your team is working on a large project that involves a lot of back and forth. You might want to be able to share and edit files that are stored in one place. 
The SMB protocol will allow your team members to use these shared files as if they were on their own hard drives. Even if one of them is on a business trip on the other 
side of the world, they can still access and use the data.
What is SMB authentication?
Like any other connection, the SMB protocol needs security measures to make communication safe. At the user level, SMB authentication requires a username and password to
allow access to the server. It is controlled by the system administrator, who can add or block users and keep tabs on who is allowed in.
At a share-level, users have to enter a one-time password to access the shared file or server, but no identity authentication is required.
