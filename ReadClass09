A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure that is specific to your company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task.
Some would say that writing an SOP is both a science and an art form.
SOPs are a primary way to implement or enforce a policy. Policies are intended to steer an organization to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of an organization,
but without SOPs, are not actionable. SOPs also encourage consistency in execution, which is critical for demonstrating compliance with or achievement of targets 
described in a service level agreement.
One of the most significant challenges in writing SOPs is that there are no hard and fast rules for writing them. A format or writing style that works for one
organization may not work as well with another organization.
Secondly, SOPs can become out of date very quickly if not regularly maintained. The business is ever-changing and evolving, and as a result, IT changes and
evolves as well. If SOPs aren’t maintained as part of those changes, they will become obsolete.
Check to ensure for the right balance regarding the number of activities within an SOP. If you don’t have enough detail, the SOP is useless; it’s not worth reading.
If you have too much detail, the SOP is useless; no one will read it. I recommend keeping an SOP in the general range of five to seven steps.
This approach helps with readability and censurability—sufficient depth without being overwhelming.
